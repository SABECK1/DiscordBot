# DiscordBot
# Features
Many features residing in the code of this bot is a lot of testing on my side, trying out different libraries and such, so it may come off as a "jack of all trades bot" with no clear goal in mind.
* Simple Random Number Generator
* Basic Music Player
* IMDB Search Function
* Web Scraping for different Dog and Cat Pictures
* Kick, Mute, Temporary Voice Channels and other commands regarding Server Administration





# DiscordBot Setup
Edit the settings.py file and input your Discord API Token after you created your own Application on the Discord Developer Portal. <br />
If you want the Bot to post Redditposts from different Subreddits you will also need to get yourself a Reddit-API-ID and Secret and an individual identification code called the user agent. <br /> If you don't, the commands simply won't work and will give you an error, which you can ignore. <br />

If you want the bot to be able to play music from youtube, then you will need to download Lavalink and put it in the same folder you run the bot from <br />


Activity1 and Activity2 are used to display what your Bot is currently doing i.e. it's status. <br />

The command prefix describes the character you need to use in front of your message for the different commands to be working. <br />

Sounds used for the "sound" command are stored in the "sounds" folder. Put your mp3 files in there and play them in your voicechannel using sound file_name
