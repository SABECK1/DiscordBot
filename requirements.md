# DiscordBotNEEDED LIBRARIES:
- youtube_dl and youtube_search
- discord.py
- PRAW: The Python Reddit API Wrapper 
- IMDbPY
- lavalink.py

Theoretically speaking, you don't need any of these libraries as the bot will still be working, 
though many of the commands will cease to work and will therefore print out error messages.

For the Music Commands it is essential for you to use the [Lavalink](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/releases).jar! Download the newest version of Lavalink and run it before starting the Bot.
